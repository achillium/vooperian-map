# Vooperian Map

I am working on a map of all of Vooperia. There will be many versions for weather, height, roads, rivers, statistical regions, administrative regions, military, timezones, currents, temperature, etc.

## Using a map:

If you want to use a map, don't download it. Instead, use one of the links below to either send to someone or embed. Using these will keep the map automatically up to date with any changes (some of which can be very important). Also if you are going to embed it, use the compressed version. The un-compressed version is large enough to crash some sites D:
